    <h1 class="title">Oops!</h1>
    <p>It looks like your screen is too small for this "masterpiece". <br /></p>
    <p>
      <br />
      But... I've got 2 solutions for you to fix this problem.
    </p>
    <h3 class="color-burlywood">First</h3>
    <p>Buy a bigger screen</p>
    <h3 class="color-burlywood">or</h3>
    <p>
      Send me money as an incentive to finish this project. Or give me a
      contract. It doesn't matter that you don't know what qualities I have.
      They are almost perfect. But if you don't believe me, just buy that screen
      and then send the money. I'll leave the order up to you.
